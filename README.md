# Why I Used Fetch API for AJAX

I used the **Fetch API** for making requests because:

1. **Simple**: It's easy to use and built into modern browsers, so I don't need any extra libraries.
2. **Promises**: It works with promises, which makes it easier to handle things like loading data without getting confused.
3. **No extra libraries**: I didn't need to use something like jQuery or Axios, which would make the project heavier.
4. **Flexibility**: Fetch can do different types of requests (GET, POST, etc.) easily.

I didn't use **XMLHttpRequest** because it’s older and more complicated, and **jQuery** because it’s not needed in modern browsers.
